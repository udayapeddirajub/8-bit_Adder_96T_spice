# 8-bit_Adder_96T_spice
This repository focuses on optimizing regular 8-bit adders in terms of area, delay, and power. The chosen adder type for optimization is the ripple carry fashion. By leveraging advanced techniques and methodologies, this project aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of 8-bit adders.
The source files for LTspice simulation are attached.
